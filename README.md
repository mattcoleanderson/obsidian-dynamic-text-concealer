# Obsidian Dynamic Text Concealer

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin to dynamically replace content of a note using user defined Regular Expressions.

## Use Cases

The main goal of this plugin is to enable users to hide ugly, verbose metadata used by other plugins that clutters your notes.

For example, [Obsidian to Anki](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki/wiki/Cloze-formatting) utilizes **curly braces** to signify a line of text that should create a **cloze note** in [Anki](https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion). This plugin can enable the user to conceal the **curly braces** in their notes.

## Showcase

### Regex used in example

When writing custom regex, the capture groups will be concealed in your notes.

## Discussions

Overtime I hope we can amass a collection of user created Regex for various use cases.

If you have a Regex you would like to share, I encourage you to leave a comment on
